# Mandelbrot Set Visualization

This repository contains code to generate and visualize the Mandelbrot set, one of the most famous fractals. The Mandelbrot set is defined by iterating a mathematical formula and determining whether the result diverges or stays bounded. This project provides a simple and efficient way to generate the Mandelbrot set and explore its intricate patterns.
